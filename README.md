I am interested in algorithmically seeking out **contradictions** and **inconsistencies** in deceitful text, specifically in "bipolar" legal text. Here is my [resume](https://github.com/quantapix/quantapix/blob/main/resume.pdf), 
personal ["history"](https://github.com/quantapix/quantapix/blob/main/history.pdf) and non-technical [references](https://github.com/quantapix/quantapix/blob/main/references.pdf).

My public repositories (see below) are under intense development with a court-imposed deadline of 5/6/2022. In preparation for that hearing, I am starting a [blog](https://github.com/quantapix/quantapix/blob/main/blog) to highlight my current, non-proprietary open source development activities.

I have been threatened, arrested (most recently on 1/21/2022, see my [petition](https://github.com/quantapix/quantapix/blob/main/petition.pdf) to the Supreme Judicial Court and my [appeal](https://github.com/quantapix/quantapix/blob/main/appeal.pdf) to the Commission Against Discrimination) and ordered to apply for 10 jobs a week. With a total of ~150 job applications submitted by 5/6/2022, I clearly cannot claim "great matches" with any of them, specifically because of the particular circumstances of my relevant work since 2017.

A successful application for an ordered full-time position would also mean abandoning my ~$1M investment in my company Quantapix, along with all my personal savings and my entire retirement at age 60.

Additionally, if my lawsuits for damages (e.g. [violations of civil rights](https://github.com/quantapix/quantapix/blob/main/rights.pdf)) fail, I certainly will be sent to jail. If my appeals and/or lawsuits succeed in the next few months, I would be left with no sane reason to abandon Quantapix.
