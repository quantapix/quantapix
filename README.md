I am interested in algorithmically seeking out **contradictions** and **inconsistencies** in deceitful text, specifically in legal text.

Here is my [resume](https://github.com/quantapix/quantapix/blob/main/resume.pdf), 
personal ["history"](https://github.com/quantapix/quantapix/blob/main/history.pdf) and non-technical [references](https://github.com/quantapix/quantapix/blob/main/references.pdf).

A sample text of my publicly accessible "Conspiracy To Silence And To Enslave" systemic violations of civil rights lawsuit is [here](https://github.com/quantapix/quantapix/blob/main/rights.pdf).

My public repositories (see below) are under intense development with an imposed deadline of 5/6/2022.
