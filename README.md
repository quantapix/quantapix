I am interested in algorithmically seeking out **contradictions** and **inconsistencies** in deceitful text, specifically in "bipolar" legal text. Here is my [resume](https://qnarre.com/resume.pdf), personal "[history](https://qnarre.com/history.pdf)," employment [disclosure](https://qnarre.com/disclosure.pdf), and non-technical [references](https://github.com/quantapix/quantapix/blob/main/references.pdf).

I have been threatened, arrested (most recently on 1/21/2022, see my petitions, appeals and complaints to the Mass. Supreme Judicial Court and the U.S. District Court at [femfas.net](https://femfas.net)) and was ordered to apply for 10 jobs a week.

With a total of over **600+ job applications** submitted by 2/28/2023, in addition to my **800+ solicitations** in 2019, I clearly cannot claim "great matches" with any of them, specifically because of the particular circumstances of my relevant work since 2017.

A successful application for an ordered full-time position would also mean abandoning my ~$1M investment in my company Quantapix, along with all my personal savings and my entire retirement at age 61.

Additionally, if my lawsuits (see [here](https://femfas.net)) fail, I certainly will be sent to jail. If my petitions, appeals and/or lawsuits succeed in the next months or years, I would be left with no sane reason to abandon Quantapix.
