I am interested in algorithmically seeking out **contradictions** and **inconsistencies** in deceitful text, specifically in "bipolar" legal text. Here is my [resume](https://github.com/quantapix/quantapix/blob/main/resume.pdf) and personal ["history."](https://github.com/quantapix/quantapix/blob/main/history.pdf)

I have been threatened, arrested (most recently on 1/21/2022, see my petitions, appeals and complaints to the U.S. Supreme Court, the U.S. Court of Appeals, First Circuit, and the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court at [femfas.net](https://femfas.net)) and was ordered to apply for 10 jobs a week.

With a total of over **2,560 job applications** submitted by 5/20/2025, including my prior **800+** solicitations for work in 2019, I clearly cannot claim "great matches" with any of them, specifically because of the particular circumstances of my relevant work since 2017.

A successful application for an obsessively ordered "full-time" position with a Massachusetts business would also mean abandoning my ~$1M investment in my also Massachusetts company, Quantapix, Inc., along with all my personal savings and my entire retirement at age 63+.

Additionally, if my lawsuits fail, I certainly will be sent to jail considering my forcedly accumulated **$450,000+** of in-arrears obligations for my dear four children (from $0 in 2018). If my petitions, appeals and/or lawsuits succeed in the next months or years, I would be left with no sane reason to abandon Quantapix.
