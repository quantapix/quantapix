I am interested in algorithmically seeking out **contradictions** and **inconsistencies** in deceitful text, specifically in "bipolar" legal text. Here is my [resume](https://qnarre.com/resume.pdf), personal ["history"]( https://qnarre.com/history.pdf) and non-technical [references](https://github.com/quantapix/quantapix/blob/main/references.pdf).

My public repositories (see below) are under development with court-imposed deadlines. Therefore, I have started a [blog](https://github.com/quantapix/quantapix/blob/main/blog.md) to highlight my current, non-proprietary open source development activities.

I have been threatened, arrested (most recently on 1/21/2022, see my petitions, appeals and complaints to the Mass. Supreme Judicial Court and the U.S. District Court at [femfas.net](https://femfas.net)) and was ordered to apply for 10 jobs a week.

With a total of over 270 job applications submitted by 7/13/2022, I clearly cannot claim "great matches" with any of them, specifically because of the particular circumstances of my relevant work since 2017.

A successful application for an ordered full-time position would also mean abandoning my ~$1M investment in my company Quantapix, along with all my personal savings and my entire retirement at age 60.

Additionally, if my lawsuits for damages (e.g. [violations of civil rights](https://femfas.net/rights)) fail, I certainly will be sent to jail. If my petitions, appeals and/or lawsuits succeed in the next months or years, I would be left with no sane reason to abandon Quantapix.
